        <p>Our objective here at Glass Web Projects is to integrate college students and small businesses within our own
            community in Indianapolis into working with one another. Here at Glass Web Projects we bring college
            students on board with our clients to assist in any possible way they can, and we are always open to new
            ideas to improve our clients' experiences. Our student interns will be asked to complete tasks that will
            help further experience and technical skills in their own field of study while simultaneously building onto
            their portfolio.</p><br/>

        <div class="question"><h3>How does this initiative benefit the students?</h3></div>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>Students are thrown into the world with a few classes under their belt, but we at Glass Web Projects
                believe that real-world know-how is vital to their survival in the workplace. We give these students a
                rich learning experience with hands-on mentoring. They walk away with the skills necessary to interact
                in a professional work environment, as well as with clients through freelancing. We're building their
                personal portfolio and giving them street-cred.</p>

        <div class="question"><h3>Do students produce professional quality work?</h3></div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                Yes! Glass Web Projects insists that our clients be 100% satisfied with every bit of service they
                receive from us, even when students are the worker bees. How do we do that?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We ensure that our students understand and follow our clients&rsquo; project plans to the last drop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We regularly meet in-person with our students to discuss any roadblocks they are experiencing and
                    walk them through a few solutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If students are not able to complete a project because of skill level, our professional team is
                    available to fill the gaps.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Glass Web Projects makes opportunities available to students at a challenging, yet not impossible
                learning level. You&rsquo;ll be happy with the results.</p>
